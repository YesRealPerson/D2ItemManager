This is a worse version of DIM that I made for fun.

Everything is hosted through Github Pages with the exception of all OAuth commands being processed through a few Cloudflare workers. No data is stored on any server that I own.

This project isn't really meant for anything than for my own personal fun but feel free to use it, it does in fact work.
